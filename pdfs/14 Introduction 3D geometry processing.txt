Point clouds
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_cloud

Array of 3D points
((x0, y0, z0),
(x1, y1, z1),
…
(xn-1, yn-1, zn-1))
11

Point clouds
• Often raw output of 3D scanners
• Points can be extended to primitives that locally
approximate surface, e.g. ellipses
• Advantages
– Simple data structure (list of coordinates, or primitives)
– Render via rasterization (e.g. splatting, draw small
ellipse per point)
• Disadvantages
– Not continuous
– No notion of topology
– Need additional structure to apply mathematical
operations (compute normals, etc.)
12

Polygon soup
• Array of separate polygons

13

Polygon soup
• Often default output of 3D modeling
programs
• Advantages
– Simple data structure
– Render via rendering pipeline, rasterization

• Disadvantages
– Not continuous
– No notion of topology
– Not possible to define „watertight“ surfaces
14

Polygon meshes
• Polygons and how they are connected to a
mesh
• Consist of vertices, edges, faces, and their
adjacencies
Vertex

Edge

Face

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon_mesh
15

Polygon meshes
• Face-vertex tables
– Other data structures possible (e.g., winged-edge
data structure https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winged_edge

x,y,z Optional,
often omitted
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon_mesh

16

Polygon meshes
• Main representation used in this class
• Advantages
– Render via rasterization
– Can make continuous and watertight surfaces
(no cracks nor gaps)
– Includes topology
– Easy to make complex shapes

• Disadvantages
– Not smooth
– But: can obtain smoothness via subdivision
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subdivision_surface

Parametric surfaces

2D parameter domain

Alternative notation: three separate functions
x: R2 → R3, y: R2 → R3, z: R2 → R3
18

Example: parametric sphere
• Spherical angles θ (elevation), φ (azimuth)
• Radius r, center x0, y0, z0

(π,2π)

Parametric surfaces
• Most CAD programs built on parametric surfaces
– NURBs (non-uniform rational b-splines)
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-uniform_rational_B-spline

• Advantages

– With explicit definition of functions f, many
mathematical operations (e.g., derivatives) and
properties (e.g., continuity) well defined
– Convenient for manual modeling

• Disadvantages

– Given arbitrary shape, fitting parametric surface is
non-trivial
– Complex shapes require stitching together multiple
parametric patches
– Some editing operations such as cutting, merging
complicated to implement
20

Boundary representations
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_representation

• Consists of connected vertices, edges, faces
• Faces can be
– Planar polygons, such as triangles
– Curved parametric patches (NURBS)

• Edges can be

– Straight line segments
– Smooth curves

Vertex
Edge
Face

21

Implicit surfaces
• 2D example

f (x,y) = 0

• Curve defined by function
f : R2 ->R
as set of points
{(x,y) : f(x,y) = 0}
y

x

22

Implicit surfaces
• 3D visualization, where f : R3 ->R
f (x,y,z) = 0
f (x,y,z) < 0

f (x,y,z) > 0

z

y

x

23

Example: implicit sphere
• Radius r, center x0, y0, z0
• Points on sphere given by set
{(x,y,z) : (x- x0)2 + (y- y0)2 + (z- z0)2 - r2 = 0}

24

Implicit surfaces
• Many alternatives to represent implicit function f
– Splines (grid of control points with polynomial
interpolation)
– Neural networks, etc.

• Advantages

– With explicit definition of functions f, many
mathematical operations (e.g., derivatives) and
properties (e.g., continuity) well defined
– Editing operations such as cutting, merging easy to
implement

• Disadvantages

– For rendering, usually conversion to triangle mesh
needed; otherwise using ray casting
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_casting

– Given arbitrary shape, fitting implicit surface nontrivial
25

Medial axis/surface
• Medial axis (2D shapes): set of all points having more
than one closest point on the object's boundary
• Medial axis with associated radius function of the
maximally inscribed discs is called medial axis
transform (MAT)
• MAT can be used to reconstruct original shape
Object boundary
Medial axis
Maximally inscribed disc

26

Medial axis/surface
• Medial surfaces of 3D objects can be
complicated, non-trivial to compute

Medial surface
27

Medial axis/surface
• Advantages
– Useful for shape analysis

• Disadvantages
– Non-trivial to compute
– Need to convert to other representation via
MAT for rendering

Shape representations and neural networks
• Which representations could benefit from
using neural networks to define shapes?
How?
• Which shape representations would be
suitable to be used as inputs or output of
neural networks? Pros/cons?

30

Summary
• Different representations have different
advantages/disadvantages
– No single, definite answer what is best

• Conversion between representations
possible, but not always trivial
• Will see some examples later in course
