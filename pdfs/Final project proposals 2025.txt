Final project proposals
• Decide on project proposal
– Pick from suggestions or your own project, within scope of course topics
– Topics may involve extension of Aris renderer, improved implementation
of algorithm from paper, synthesis of techniques from several papers
– Encourage research content, novelty

• Send e-mail to instructor with your choice by Tuesday Nov. 4
– List team members (up to two)
– Instructor will answer questions, approve student-defined projects, etc.

• Deliverables
– Report (4-8 pages)
– Code
– Result images and comparisons

• May work in groups of 2, need to specify division of work in report
• Deadline: Tuesday December 13 (reading day), 11:59pm
• Note: final exam Thursday, Dec. 18, 10:30am - 12:30pm, IRB2107

1. Advanced rendering algorithms
• For example, advanced
sampling strategies,
bidirectional path
tracing, path guiding,
improved neural
radiosity, etc.
• Learn from PBRT book
https://www.pbr-book.org/

• Goals
– Build on existing path tracing code
– Demonstrate capabilities, improvements vs.
simple, unidirectional path tracing
3

2. Advanced appearance model
• Participating media, subsurface scattering,
hair, advanced BRDF models, etc.
• Build on existing code
• Learn from PBRT book
https://www.pbr-book.org/

• Demonstrate using a nice scene

4

3. Geometry processing using deep learning
• Re-implement, experiment with, improve existing
methods
– Study hyperparameters, identify disadvantages/failure
cases, perform ablation studies

• E.g. surface reconstruction from point clouds
– Start with simple approach, e.g. “Implicit Geometric
Regularization for Learning Shapes”

4. Inverse rendering (NeRF etc.)

• Build on existing code repos https://docs.nerf.studio/ or
implement in code framework used for class
• Experiment with, improve existing methods
– Study hyperparameters, identify
disadvantages/failure cases, perform ablation
studies

NeRF, https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08934

6

5. Generative modeling
• E.g., diffusion models
– Images, video, geometry

7

6. Your own research project

• Related to rendering, 3D geometry, image
synthesis, or beyond (vision, optics)
• Get instructor’s approval

Grading
• Report (4-8 pages):
–
–
–
–

Description of problem that was addressed
If applicable: summary of own previous work on problem
Brief summary of related literature
Explanation of implemented algorithm/approach, including description
of existing code that was used
– Description of data gathered for the project (if applicable)
– Presentation of experimental results, including (if applicable) numerical
comparisons, visual comparisons, parameter studies (influence of
different algorithm parameters), ablation studies (influence of different
system components)
– Conclusions

• Criteria for grading: comprehensiveness, clarity, support of textual
explanations with additional data (images, numerical data,
explanatory figures), technical depth, initiative to develop own
improvements/extensions of existing algorithms/approaches
• Code, criteria for grading: clarity, correct functionality, technical
difficulty, range ("amount") of functionality
