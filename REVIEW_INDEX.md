## Study Tips

1. **Start with fundamentals** - Make sure you understand Part 1 thoroughly before moving to advanced topics
2. **Practice derivations** - Be able to derive key equations from first principles
3. **Understand the connections** - Many topics build on each other (e.g., Monte Carlo → Rendering Equation → BDPT)
4. **Visualize concepts** - Practice sketching diagrams for rendering equations, light paths, sampling strategies
5. **Work through problems** - The practice problems mirror exam-style questions
6. **Use PDF references** - Each lecture file links to the corresponding PDF for detailed review

## Exam Format Reminders

- Questions typically require **text answers, equations, and sketches**
- Some questions involve **calculations** based on example problems
- **No multiple choice questions** typically
- Be prepared to:
  - Derive equations
  - Explain concepts clearly
  - Draw diagrams
  - Solve numerical problems
  - Compare and contrast different techniques
